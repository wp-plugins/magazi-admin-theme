== Description ==

A clean, minimalistic administration theme inspired from the new customizer look of wordpress 3.4.1
It's pretty basic and adds a css file to your administration.

Since this plugin was created I have used the knowledge that I have acquired to build the bootstrap admin theme, which I would recomend you use instead of this one.
You can get it here: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bootstrap-admin/

This project was built for the http://magazi.org network of stores.
